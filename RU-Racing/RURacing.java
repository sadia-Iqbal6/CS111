 * raceway that will have racers moving through it at different runtimes. We
 * will start with a simple raceway and move on to more complex ones. Each
 * racer will move a certain distance through the raceway based on their
 * runtime (i.e., O(1), O(n), ...). Do not let racers run through the grass!

 * Ready? Set? Go!

     * Alright, we need to create a raceway.

     * Let's use a 2D character array to represent a map that will contain the
     * raceway.
     * 
     * The 2D array will be interpreted in the following manner: points on the
     * array will be represented by the x and y coordinates. The x-coordinate
     * will be the column and the y-coordinate will be the row. We will store
     * points in an (x, y) format. The top-left corner of the map will be
     * (0, 0). The bottom-right corner will be (size - 1, size - 1).
     * 
     * All variables that represent the map will be of type char and have been
     * provided as constants for you above. We'll use the '#' character
     * (char ROAD) to represent the road and the '.' (char GRASS) character
     * to represent the grass.
     * 
     * Draw a road between two given points on a given map. The road should be
     * a straight line between the two points (horizontal or vertical only). 
     * The road must be drawn using the ROAD constant. This method will exclude 
     * diagonal lines.
     *
